/**
  @target ESNext - Specifies the version of ECMAScript that the generated JavaScript should be compatible with. ESNext represents the latest supported version.
  @module commonjs - Specifies the module system for the generated JavaScript. CommonJS is the standard for Node.js environments.
  @types ["node"] - Lists the type declaration packages to be included in compilation. Including "node" allows TypeScript to recognize Node.js built-ins like 'process', 'fs', and '__dirname'.
  @allowJs - Allows JavaScript files to be compiled along with TypeScript files.
  @strict - Enables all strict type-checking options to ensure maximum type safety.
  @include - Specifies an array of file or directory paths to include in the compilation. Here, we include all .ts files within the src directory and its subdirectories.
